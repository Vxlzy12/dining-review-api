# Codecademy Dining Review API portfolio project #

ðŸŒ± Using Spring Boot, this project consists of developing a REST API implementing the necessary functions to create, read and update reviews and restaurants.
This project also implements a function to set a new review as **PENDING**, **ACCEPTED** or **DENIED**, which can be changed by an admin.
